# Theoretical Background {#theoretical-background}

This chapter provides the theoretical foundation for the Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) framework and its implementation in this agent-based model.

## The ASA Framework

The Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) framework, developed by Benjamin Schneider (1987), explains how organizations naturally evolve toward homogeneity through three interrelated processes:

### Attraction

Individuals are differentially attracted to organizations based on perceived fit between their personal characteristics and organizational attributes.

**In our model:**
- Agents calculate attraction based on:
  - Identity similarity (homophily preference)
  - Organizational diversity (diversity preference)
  - Personality alignment

### Selection

Organizations preferentially select individuals who fit their criteria and culture.

**In our model:**
- Selection can be based on:
  - Conscientiousness scores
  - Overall fit metrics
  - Random selection (baseline)

### Attrition

Individuals who don't fit well with the organization are more likely to leave.

**In our model:**
- Turnover occurs through:
  - Satisfaction thresholds
  - Probabilistic turnover based on satisfaction
  - Tenure effects

## Agent Characteristics

### Personality Traits (Big Five)

Each agent possesses five personality dimensions based on the Five-Factor Model:

1. **Openness**: Creativity, curiosity, and openness to new experiences
2. **Conscientiousness**: Organization, dependability, and work ethic
3. **Extraversion**: Sociability, assertiveness, and energy
4. **Agreeableness**: Cooperation, trust, and helpfulness
5. **Emotional Stability**: Calmness, resilience, and emotional control

These traits are normally distributed (mean = 0, sd = 1) in the population.

### Identity Categories

Agents belong to discrete identity categories (default: A, B, C, D, E) representing:
- Functional backgrounds
- Professional identities
- Cultural groups
- Or any categorical distinction relevant to the simulation

### Preferences

Two key preferences drive agent behavior:

1. **Homophily Preference**: Attraction to similar others
2. **Diversity Preference**: Attraction to organizational variety

## Interaction Dynamics

### Interaction Valence Calculation

When agents interact, the quality (valence) of the interaction is determined by:

```
Valence = -|ΔExtraversion| + (Conscientiousnessfocal - Extraversionpartner) 
          + Agreeablenessfocal + IdentityBonus + ε
```

Where:
- `ΔExtraversion`: Difference in extraversion (similarity is beneficial)
- `IdentityBonus`: Homophily preference if same identity, diversity preference if different
- `ε`: Random component scaled by emotional stability

### Satisfaction Dynamics

Agent satisfaction integrates multiple components:

```
Satisfaction = BaseAttraction + InteractionHistory + IdentityFit 
               + DiversityComponent + PersonalityStability
```

## Organizational Metrics

### Identity Diversity

We use Shannon entropy to measure identity diversity:

```
H = -Σ(pi × log(pi))
```

Where pi is the proportion of identity category i.

### Organizational Personality

The organization's personality profile is characterized by:
- Mean levels of each Big Five trait
- Standard deviations indicating personality diversity

## Temporal Dynamics

The model operates in discrete time steps, typically representing:
- Days, weeks, or months
- Configurable based on research needs

Key temporal processes:
- **Hiring cycles**: Periodic recruitment and selection
- **Interaction accumulation**: Building relationship history
- **Tenure effects**: Time-dependent behaviors

## Emergent Phenomena

The ASA model produces several emergent patterns:

1. **Homogenization**: Organizations become more similar over time
2. **Culture crystallization**: Dominant characteristics become reinforced
3. **Fit spirals**: Good fit → satisfaction → retention → stronger culture
4. **Diversity cycles**: Tension between homophily and diversity preferences

## Model Assumptions

Key assumptions in our implementation:

1. **Perfect information**: Applicants can assess organizational fit
2. **Stable preferences**: Agent preferences don't change
3. **Random interactions**: Agents interact randomly (can be modified)
4. **Linear satisfaction**: Components combine additively

## Extensions and Variations

The framework supports several extensions:

1. **Network structures**: Replace random with network-based interactions
2. **Multiple organizations**: Inter-organizational mobility
3. **Dynamic environments**: Changing selection criteria
4. **Team structures**: Nested organizational units
