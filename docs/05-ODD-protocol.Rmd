# ODD Protocol {#odd-protocol}

This chapter presents the ASA ABM v2 following the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol (Grimm et al., 2010, 2020). The ODD protocol provides a standardized way to describe agent-based models.

## 1. Purpose and Patterns

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this model is to simulate the Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) processes in organizations to understand:

1. **Primary Questions:**
   - How do organizations evolve toward homogeneity through ASA processes?
   - What role do individual preferences (homophily vs. diversity) play in organizational composition?
   - How do different selection strategies affect long-term organizational diversity?
   - What are the dynamics of satisfaction and turnover in evolving organizations?

2. **Secondary Questions:**
   - How does interaction frequency affect organizational culture formation?
   - What is the relationship between personality diversity and organizational stability?
   - How do hiring cycles and growth rates influence organizational evolution?

### 1.2 Patterns

The model aims to reproduce and explain the following patterns observed in organizational research:

1. **Organizational Homogenization**: Organizations tend to become more homogeneous over time
2. **Fit-Satisfaction-Retention Spiral**: Better fitting employees are more satisfied and stay longer
3. **Diversity-Performance Relationship**: Complex relationships between diversity and organizational outcomes
4. **Turnover Cascades**: Departures can trigger additional turnover through social effects

## 2. Entities, State Variables, and Scales

### 2.1 Entities

The model contains three types of entities:

1. **Agents (Employees and Applicants)**
   - Represent individuals who work in or apply to the organization
   - Possess personality traits, identity, and preferences
   - Can transition from applicant to employee

2. **Organization**
   - Collection of agents marked as active employees
   - Emergent properties calculated from constituent agents

3. **Interactions**
   - Pairwise encounters between agents
   - Store history of social experiences

### 2.2 State Variables

#### Agent-level State Variables

| Variable | Type | Range/Values | Description |
|----------|------|--------------|-------------|
| agent_id | character | Unique string | Unique identifier |
| identity_category | character | "A"-"E" (default) | Categorical identity |

| conscientiousness | numeric | ~N(0,1) | Big Five personality trait |
| extraversion | numeric | ~N(0,1) | Big Five personality trait |

| personality_sds | numeric vector | SD of each Big Five trait |

#### Global Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| time | integer | Current simulation step |
| parameters | list | Simulation parameters |

### 2.3 Scales

- **Temporal Scale**: 
  - One time step typically represents one week
  - Simulations typically run for 260-520 steps (1-2 years)
  - Hiring cycles occur every 4-12 steps

- **Organizational Scale**:
  - Organizations range from 10 to 10,000+ agents
  - Typical simulations use 100-1,000 agents

## 3. Process Overview and Scheduling

### 3.1 Process Overview

Each time step consists of the following processes in order:

1. **Update Tenure**: Increment tenure for all active agents
2. **Execute Interactions**: Agents interact with randomly selected partners
3. **Update Satisfaction**: Calculate new satisfaction based on interactions
4. **Execute Turnover**: Remove agents below satisfaction threshold
5. **Hiring Cycle** (periodic):
   - Age applicant pool
   - Recruit new applicants
   - Calculate applicant attraction
   - Filter applicant pool
   - Select and hire new employees
6. **Calculate Metrics**: Record organizational state

### 3.2 Scheduling

- **Sequential Processing**: Processes execute in the order listed above
- **Synchronous Updates**: All agents update simultaneously within each process
- **Discrete Time**: All events occur at discrete time steps
- **Conditional Execution**: Hiring only occurs at specified intervals

## 4. Design Concepts

### 4.1 Basic Principles

The model implements the ASA framework through:
- **Attraction**: Differential attraction based on fit
- **Selection**: Preferential hiring of fitting individuals
- **Attrition**: Satisfaction-based turnover

### 4.2 Emergence

The following properties emerge from individual-level behaviors:
- Organizational culture (personality profile)
- Identity composition and diversity
- Turnover patterns and rates
- Social network properties (implicit in interactions)

### 4.3 Adaptation

Agents adapt through:
- Satisfaction updates based on experiences
- Turnover decisions based on satisfaction
- No learning or trait changes (fixed personalities)

### 4.4 Objectives

Agents seek to:
- Applicants: Join organizations with high attraction
- Employees: Maintain satisfaction above threshold
- Organization: Hire best-fitting applicants (implicit)

### 4.5 Learning

No explicit learning in current model. Agents have fixed traits and preferences.

### 4.6 Prediction

Agents implicitly predict:
- Applicants assess organizational fit before joining
- Employees evaluate satisfaction trends (through threshold mechanism)

### 4.7 Sensing

Agents can sense:
- Organizational identity composition (for attraction calculation)
- Interaction partner characteristics (during interactions)
- Own satisfaction level

### 4.8 Interaction

- **Direct**: Pairwise interactions between agents
- **Indirect**: Through organizational composition effects
- **Interaction Selection**: Random pairing (extensible to networks)

### 4.9 Stochasticity

Stochastic elements include:
- Agent trait initialization (~N(0,1))
- Identity assignment (uniform random)
- Interaction partner selection (random)
- Interaction valence noise (scaled by emotional stability)
- Hiring decisions (when using random selection)

### 4.10 Collectives

The organization represents a collective with emergent properties calculated from member characteristics.

### 4.11 Observation

The model collects:
- Time series of organizational metrics
- Final organization state
- Periodic snapshots (configurable)
- Interaction histories

## 5. Initialization

### 5.1 Initial Conditions

Default initialization:
```r
# Create initial organization
initial_size = 100
identity_categories = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")

# Agents initialized with:
- Random identities (uniform distribution)
- Personality traits ~ N(0,1)
- Preferences ~ N(0,1)
- Attraction = 0
- Satisfaction = 0
- Tenure = 0
- All marked as active
```

### 5.2 Input Data

The model can accept:
- Custom identity category definitions
- Specified initial organization size
- Parameter configurations
- Random seed for reproducibility

## 6. Input Data

No external data files required. All agent characteristics generated stochastically during initialization.

## 7. Submodels

### 7.1 Attraction Calculation

**For Applicants:**
```
Attraction = (HomophilyPref × PropSameIdentity) + 
             (DiversityPref × DiversityIndex)
```

### 7.2 Interaction Valence

**When agents i and j interact:**
```
Valence_ij = -|Extraversion_i - Extraversion_j| +
             (Conscientiousness_i - Extraversion_j) +
             Agreeableness_i +
             IdentityBonus + 
             ε
             
Where:
- IdentityBonus = HomophilyPref_i if same identity, 
                  DiversityPref_i if different
- ε ~ N(0, |EmotionalStability_i|)
```

### 7.3 Satisfaction Update

```
Satisfaction_i = Attraction_i +
                 mean(RecentInteractionValences) +
                 (HomophilyPref_i × PropSameIdentity) +
                 (DiversityPref_i × DiversityIndex) +
                 EmotionalStability_i
```

### 7.4 Turnover Decision

**Threshold Model:**
```
if (Satisfaction < TurnoverThreshold) then Leave
```

**Probabilistic Model:**
```
P(Leave) = BaseTurnoverRate / (1 + exp(Satisfaction × Weight))
```

### 7.5 Hiring Process

1. Rank applicants by criterion (conscientiousness/fit/random)
2. Select top N where N = CurrentSize × GrowthRate
3. Convert selected applicants to employees
4. Add to organization

### 7.6 Identity Diversity

**Shannon Entropy:**
```
H = -Σ(p_i × log(p_i))
```
Where p_i is the proportion of identity category i.
