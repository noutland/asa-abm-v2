# ASA Agent-Based Model v2

A high-performance, extensible agent-based model for simulating Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) dynamics in organizations.

## Overview

This model simulates how organizations evolve through the interplay of:
- **Attraction**: How individuals are drawn to organizations
- **Selection**: How organizations choose new members  
- **Attrition**: How and why members leave organizations

## Features

- ðŸš€ High-performance implementation using `data.table`
- ðŸ“Š Comprehensive metrics and visualization
- ðŸ”§ Modular, extensible architecture
- ðŸ“š Complete documentation with examples
- ðŸ§ª Ready for research and experimentation

## Quick Start

```r
# Load the simulation engine
source("asa_abm_v2/simulation/engine.R")

# Run a basic simulation
results <- run_asa_simulation(
  n_steps = 260,      # One year weekly
  initial_size = 100  # Starting employees
)

# View results
summary(results$metrics)
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` folder:
- Getting Started Guide
- Theoretical Background
- User Guide
- API Reference
- Examples and Case Studies

### Building Documentation
```r
cd asa_abm_v2/docs
source("build_documentation.R")
```
